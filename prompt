The Envious Racing website will reflect the high-energy, automotive-inspired design of the provided logo, focusing on a bold, sleek, and modern look that resonates with drag racing enthusiasts. 
Headings and Titles: Use a bold, condensed sans-serif font similar to the logo’s “ENVIOUS RACING” text, such as "Racing Sans One" or "Impact." Apply uppercase formatting, slight italicization for a sense of speed, and a metallic effect (e.g., subtle gradient or text-shadow) to mimic the logo’s 3D style.
Body Text: Use a clean, readable sans-serif font like "Roboto" or "Montserrat" for paragraphs, inputs, and labels to ensure clarity while maintaining a modern feel.
Special Text (e.g., “CHAOTIC”): For secondary branding elements like “CHAOTIC,” use a stencil-style font similar to the logo, such as "Staatliches," to replicate the angular, aggressive vibe.
Colors:
Primary Palette:
Red (#FF0000): Matches the logo’s vibrant red accents, used for highlights, buttons, and active states.
Black (#000000): Background color to create a high-contrast, dramatic effect, inspired by the logo’s dark backdrop.
Silver/Chrome (#C0C0C0): For metallic elements, borders, and text, reflecting the logo’s chrome-like finish.
Accent Colors:
White (#FFFFFF): For primary text and secondary elements to ensure readability.
Neon Red: For underglow effects (e.g., scrollbar, hover states) to add a futuristic, car-inspired touch.
Background Patterns: Incorporate a subtle hexagonal grid pattern (as seen in the logo’s background) for section backgrounds, with a semi-transparent black overlay to maintain focus on content.
